# EV Charging Demand Prediction â€“Edunet-Shell Skills4Future AICTE Internship
  WEEK 1 SUBMISSION:
  #Problem Statement:
This project aims to predict the demand for EV vehicle charging stations using machine learning models. By analyzing historical charging data, we intend to provide insights on peak usage hours, high-demand locations, and build a model to predict future charging demand.  
This can help optimize charging station infrastructure and improve energy resource management.
It includes the dataset, exploratory data analysis and related visualizations completed in Week 1.

WEEK -2 SUBMISSION:
In Week 2, I enhanced the project with meaningful data visualizations to provide deeper insights. I added a Monthly EV Trend Line to understand seasonality, compared EV vs Non-EV growth over the years, analyzed Top 10 counties by EV penetration (%), and visualized the Year-on-Year EV growth rate (%). These insights help identify regional trends and support better infrastructure planning
