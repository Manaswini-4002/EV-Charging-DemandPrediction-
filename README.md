# EV Charging Demand Prediction â€“Edunet-Shell Skills4Future AICTE Internship
  WEEK 1 SUBMISSION:-
#Problem Statement:
This project aims to predict the demand for EV vehicle charging stations using machine learning models. By analyzing historical charging data, we intend to provide insights on peak usage hours, high-demand locations, and build a model to predict future charging demand.  
This can help optimize charging station infrastructure and improve energy resource management.
It includes the dataset, exploratory data analysis and related visualizations completed in Week 1.
